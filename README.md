# Todo App

In this project, I was tasked with translating old JS code into it's new efficient current structure. Refactoring, as well as better organization, to help it load more quickly. All the while making sure the app worked according to the rubric and that validation requirements were met.

## Functionality

This app allows you to create new to-do's, with a description and due date if desired. In addition, you can delete each item. The "submit" button on the create to-do modal require appropriate validation before being enabled.

## Technology

Validation methods utilized to enable or disable the submit button.

After the user fills in the form, but does not submit it, then closes the modal, the content entered remains in the fields for the user's convenience. The fields are only reset when the page is reloaded, or the "create" button is submitted.
